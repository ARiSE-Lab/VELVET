# VELVET: a noVel Ensemble Learning approach to automatically locate VulnErable sTatements ([SANER 2022](https://saner2022.uom.gr/restrack))

This [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10893) presents VELVET, a novel ensemble learning approach to locate vulnerable statements. Our model combines graph-based and sequence-based neural networks to successfully capture the local and global context of a program graph and effectively understand code semantics and vulnerable patterns. This work is done by researchers from Columbia University and IBM Research.

## Data

This paper considers two datasets as the main resources for the evaluation:
* [Juliet Test Suite for C/C++](https://samate.nist.gov/SRD/testsuite.php)
* [IBM D2A Dataset](https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/data/all/d2a/) (Publication regarding this dataset can be found here: [Zheng _et al._](https://conf.researchr.org/details/icse-2021/icse-2021-Software-Engineering-in-Practice/28/D2A-A-Dataset-Built-for-AI-Based-Vulnerability-Detection-Methods-Using-Differential-))

Data and code for our SANER 2022 paper. More details are coming soon....
